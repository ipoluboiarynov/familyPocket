|  | Demonstrates initiative and thoughtful planning to leverage available resources (time, equipment, external expertise) to meet milestones and project objectives. | greatly exceeds.  This project shows great creativity and work ethic |
|  | Evidence of significant revision and incorporation of feedback. | met. |
|  | Project complexity | Exceeds class requirements. From the display it looks easy to follow but looking through all the files this shows a great amount of work and time went into this.  Great job |
| You have a lot of checklists but very few things checked off.  Just to keep it easier to look at what's finished I'd just try to keep this updated | Additional Comments |  |
