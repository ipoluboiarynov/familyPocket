# Family Pocket app by Ivan Poluboiarynov

### Problem statement

Each of us has several bank cards, cash, perhaps even saving accounts, and so on. And if someone asks us how much we 
have earned and spent money in the last month and how much money we have now, then few of us will answer this simple 
but important question correctly. Family finances are a very hot topic. This can affect relationships, the future of 
the family. Keeping records of the household budget is the way to stability, forecasting, and therefore to family 
happiness. Know, control, analyze and plan your budget is a function of the Family Pocket app. Be happy and love each 
other, and our application will provide order in your money matters.
